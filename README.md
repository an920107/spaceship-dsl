# Spaceship DSL

## Environement

> [!NOTE]
> This project is using nightly Rust features (for compile-time slot checking). Make sure to use a nightly toolchain. Although there is a `rust-toolchain.toml` file included in the project, you can also set the override manually by running:
>
> ```bash
> rustup override set nightly
> ```
